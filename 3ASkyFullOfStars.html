        <h3>Description About the Author:</h3>
        <p>Coldplay is a British rock band known for their melodic piano-driven anthems that have lifted the band to the top of the pop music world in the early 21st century. The band's music spans various genres, including electronica, R&B, ambient, disco, funk, gospel, blues, and progressive rock. Coldplay's song "Viva la Vida" is notable for being the first song by a British act to reach number one in the United States and United Kingdom simultaneously in the 21st century. The band's Music of the Spheres World Tour is the most-attended and second-highest-grossing tour of all time, becoming the first by a band to gross $1 billion. Coldplay's song "My Universe" from the album Music of the Spheres was the first song by a British group to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
